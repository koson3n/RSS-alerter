Purpose of this program
------------------------

This program was made for the sole purpose of being able to receive instant alert
 when a forum post containing cer tain words would pop up. After that functionality
 was done it was clear that the program could have other uses and I decided to continue
  development for a bit longer and make couple of more functionalities so it would be 
  easier to continue its development.
