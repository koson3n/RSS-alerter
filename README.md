What is RSS Alerter?
---------------------
It is a simple software to keep you updated of your favourite forum, news site or blog.
Basically anything that has or can be made to .rss feed. This is for those who don't like 
browser bloatware solutions and for those who want to look over the code before installing 
software. You can of course clone this repo and make the program work in the way you want to 
if you feel the need.


Purpose of this program
------------------------

This program was made for the sole purpose of being able to receive instant alert
 when a forum post containing cer tain words would pop up. After that functionality
 was done it was clear that the program could have other uses and I decided to continue
  development for a bit longer and make couple of more functionalities so it would be 
  easier to continue its development.
